# Overview
This project involves designing and developing a simple 4-bit nanoprocessor capable of executing basic instructions using VHDL. This project emphasizes individual technical skills and teamwork in creating digital systems.

# Key Components
4-bit Add/Subtract Unit: Handles arithmetic operations using 2's complement.
3-bit Program Counter: Manages the sequencing of instructions.
Register Bank: Stores data in 8 registers (R0 to R7).
Program ROM: Stores the assembly program hard-coded into ROM.
Instruction Decoder: Decodes and executes the instructions.
Steven Segment Display: Displays the output of the nano processor.
